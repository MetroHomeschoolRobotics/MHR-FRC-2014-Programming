Any time you start editing code, copy-paste the existing code folder, then add
the date to the folder name in this format: " - YYYY-MM-DD" after the title.


Also, I love and hate Symlinks at the same time.

But... I have to symlink this directory to another directory so I can get around Windriver's hate of spaces.

Dalton, look up mklink.

Anyone else using Windriver, also look it up.

Plz dnt brk drpbx n teh prcss...

zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

Also, really convoluted, making Windriver work with the symlink.  If you care that much to find out, talk to Joey.
He doesn't care to put it in this not-even-a-readme at the time of writing.  He is tired and would love to zzzzzzz...
